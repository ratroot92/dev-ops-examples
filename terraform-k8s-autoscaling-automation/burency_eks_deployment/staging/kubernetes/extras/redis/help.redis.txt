Confusions  and shortcomings :

1-Need to test whether redis json module and Redis search modules are working or not 

2-Could not find out yet if clustering is optimizing the availability and performance 

3-Redis Cluster is unsecured  (no connection authenticated applied yet )



attaching screenshots for understanding the purpose
